##Gmail Plugin

The Gmail plugin allows you to use Quicksilver to send email via the Compose Email, Email Item..., and Email To... actions, through Gmail.

To enable Quicksilver to send email using the Gmail plugin, go to Quicksilver's Preferences, and within the 'Handlers' tab, choose 'Gmail Plugin' as the Mail Handler from the dropdown list.

Once set, open the [Gmail preferences](qs://preferences#QSGmailPluginPrefs) and enter your username and password. This information is stored securely in the Apple OS X Keychain.
